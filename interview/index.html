   <h3> Why do you want to be a designer?</h3>
    <p> Since I was a kid, I already like to create things by hands. I like handmade things and architecture drawing, in my secondary and high school, I had chances to do some works about that and I was really into it. I feel comfortable with art or fashions although I’m not quite good at them. </p>

<h3> What makes you nervous about becoming a designer?</h3>

<p> I’m afraid to be lacking of creativity when we just have limited time but we still have to work on the project. I think, as a designer, we cannot work effectively under pressure conditions, it will make us less creative. As a human, we have periods when we stuck in or stressed out. In that situation, I prefer stopping and use our time to relax, go travel, get the inspiration from around the world, and then comfortably go back to work.

<h3> What excites you about design?</h3>

<p> So far, I really enjoy and focus on the projects when I do web design, vector design, layout design. They are what I‘m interested in. When I’m working on them, I feel really fun to do, not something I’m forced to study.

<h3> What are your strengths?</h3>

<p> I think I’m kind of confident that my ideas coming quick. Moreover, although still in the college environment, whenever receiving a project, I really care about the content, I want to make sure I follow and meet the requirements of the projects. I think this is helpful for after graduating career when a graphic design have to understand thoughtfully the message the brand wants to say and try best to achieve expressing their message.

<h3> What are some areas of opportunity to work on?</h3>

<p> Areas of my career could be poster design, branding, book layout. Another area of career could be some long-time required work that need patience, I’m really persevering in doing anything. I prefer to work for a company at first, not a freelancer.

<h3> What aspects of graphic design to you gravitate towards?</h3>

<p> I am more of a vector designer or photographer than a painting artist. I have to learn and try more on illustrations and animations because I believe I shouldn’t limit myself as a graphic designer.

<h3> What are the roles and responsibilities of a graphic design in society? </h3>

<p> People create graphic design to express everything in a easier visual way. Graphic that is designed contains a certain information, make the information more attractive, more interesting to look at. Graphic makes the brand, the company differ from each other, bringing values to them. </p>

<h3> When/where/why are you at your most creative/productive?</h3>

<p> I am an extrovert so I feel I get more ideas on the day when I go out. However, to work on coding or something that really needs to focus, I prefer quiet environment. I can say I am easily getting productive when I know what and how many projects, assignments I have.</p>

<h3> What are your comfort levels with giving and receiving feedback? How might you improve your skills here? What strategies have worked for you?</h3>

<p> As a learner, there are so many things that I haven’t known about yet, I’m really open to receive feedbacks. After getting feedbacks, if I have my own opinions and I will explain it to the people, and then we will discuss until figuring out a better way. 
I will try to make another version based on the feedbacks. I think without critics from professors or even friends, I couldn’t improve and learn anything new. </p>

<h3> What is a website? </h3>

<p> A website can be simple called just a online page to visit but it actually is defined depends on the view of individuals. To web designers, we look at how the website was built up, we inspect tons of code behind websites. To businesses and customers, this is one of the main means to introduce them to the customers, and from there provide what customers needs... In general, a website is created by a lot of coding, ideas, and the information, it is an achievement of a web designer who created it.</p>
